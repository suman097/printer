Olive ridley sea- turtles nest on Gahirmatha and other nearby beaches. Bhitarkanika has one of the largest populations of endangered salt water crocodile in India and is globaly unique in that of 10 per cent of the adults exceed 6 m length.Some wildlife experts are of the opinion that the largest saltwater crocodile ever was in Bhitarkanika, measuring an estimated 23 feet (7.0 m) which could be traced from the skull preserved by the Kanika Royal Family.The crocodile was shot near Dhamara in 1926, and later its skull was preserved by the then Kanika King. Crocodile experts estimate the animal to have been between 20 feet (6.1 m) and 23 feet (7.0 m) long, as the size of the skull was measured one ninth of the total length of the body.
                                215 species of avifauna including eight varieties of kingfishers.Birds such as Asian open Bill, Cormorants, Darters, Egrets, are frequently seen in the Bhitarkanika National Park.</p>
